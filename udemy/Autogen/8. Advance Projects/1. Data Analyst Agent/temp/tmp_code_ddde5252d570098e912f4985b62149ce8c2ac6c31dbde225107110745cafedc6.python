import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Step 2: Explore the data (not running exploration code since executing that isn't idle here)
# I'll assume there's a column like 'Survived' where 0 might be died and 1 might be survived

# Step 3: Calculate the counts of people who survived and who didn't
survival_counts = data['Survived'].value_counts()

# Step 4: Plot the graph
plt.bar(['Died', 'Survived'], survival_counts, color=['red', 'green'])
plt.title("Survival Counts")
plt.xlabel("Outcome")
plt.ylabel("Number of People")

# Step 5: Save the graph as 'output.png'
plt.savefig('output.png')

print("Graph has been plotted and saved as 'output.png'.")
