# Load the data

# Basic Understanding
# Let's see if there are columns similar to 'Age', 'Sex', 'Pclass', etc., that might influence survival.
print(data.head())

# Brief Analysis
survived = data[data['Survived'] == 1]
died = data[data['Survived'] == 0]

# Example analysis on 'Age'
avg_survived_age = survived['Age'].mean()
avg_died_age = died['Age'].mean()

# Gender influence
male_survival_rate = survived[survived['Sex'] == 'male'].shape[0] / data[data['Sex'] == 'male'].shape[0]
female_survival_rate = survived[survived['Sex'] == 'female'].shape[0] / data[data['Sex'] == 'female'].shape[0]

# Class influence
pclass_survival = survived['Pclass'].value_counts(normalize=True)

# In conclusion, some key contributing factors are often:
# - Gender: In most cases, more females survive than males.
# - Age: Sometimes younger or older individuals might have different survival rates depending on assistance received.
# - Class: Higher socio-economic class individuals might have better access to life-saving resources.
